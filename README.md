# CUtils #
This repo has some C stuff I wrote. I originally did this because a friend needed some histograms in the terminal and ncurses seemed like overengineering.

## What's found here ##
### drawHist ###
This is a utility for making and formatting 'Histograms' (Really more like bar charts but Histograms are just specialized bar charts) in the terminal or 
to output them to a file. Documentation for this can be found [here](https://glaedwyn.bitbucket.io)

### vector ###
Basic dynamic array with a helper macro for looping over entries.
